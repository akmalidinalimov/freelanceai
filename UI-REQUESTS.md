# UI ⇄ Platform request board

Cross-team async channel (see CONTRIBUTING.md). UI team: write requests for backend
changes here instead of editing platform files. Platform team: write UI tasks that
need frontend work here instead of editing components.

## → For the UI team

### 1. Account data-export + deletion controls (Settings page)
Backend is live; needs UI in `src/components/settings-form.tsx` (or a new section on
the settings page):
- **"Download my data"** button → `GET /api/me/export` (auth'd) → offer the JSON as a
  file download (`freelanceai-data.json`).
- **"Delete account"** (danger zone) → confirm dialog requiring the user to type
  `DELETE` → `POST /api/me/delete` body `{"confirm":"DELETE"}`.
  - `409 CONFLICT` responses carry a message: active orders must finish first, or a
    seller balance must be withdrawn first — surface it.
  - On success `{ok:true}` the session is already destroyed server-side → redirect to `/`.
- i18n: add keys in all three locales under a new `Account` namespace.

### 2. Instagram connect + synced portfolio (profile editor & public profile)
Backend is live (env-gated until Meta setup; see docs/instagram-go-live.md):
- **Profile editor** (`src/app/[locale]/dashboard/seller/profile/page.tsx` area):
  - "Connect Instagram" button → plain link to `GET /api/instagram/connect`
    (redirects to Instagram; comes back to the editor with `?ig=connected|error|unavailable`
    — show a toast/badge per marker).
  - When connected (SellerProfile.instagramUserId set): show "@handle · connected",
    last-synced time (instagramSyncedAt), and a "Disconnect" button →
    `POST /api/instagram/disconnect` (removes synced items too — warn in the dialog).
- **Public profile**: portfolio items now carry `source` ("upload"|"instagram") and
  `permalink`. Per the approved design-b2-profile.html mockup: horizontal snap
  carousel; ▶ overlay for `mediaType === "video"` (image is the poster; link out
  to `permalink`); "↗ Instagram'da koʻrish" link on synced items; keep manual
  uploads first (they have position < 100).
- i18n keys under an `Instagram` namespace, all three locales.
